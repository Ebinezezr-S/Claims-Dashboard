📊 Claims Dashboard
📝 Project Overview

This project focuses on creating an interactive dashboard to monitor and analyze insurance/mortgage claims. The goal is to provide insights into claim trends, delays, and recoveries to support decision-making and operational efficiency.

🎯 Objectives

Consolidate claims data from multiple sources (mortgage, insurance).

Perform data cleaning and transformation for analysis.

Build an interactive dashboard for key metrics visualization.

Identify patterns and insights for process improvement.
